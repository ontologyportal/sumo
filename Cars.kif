(documentation InternalCombustionEngine EnglishLanguage "The internal combustion 
engine is an engine in which the combustion of a fuel (normally a fossil fuel) 
occurs with an oxidizer (usually air) in a combustion chamber. In an internal 
combustion engine, the expansion of the high-temperature and high -pressure 
gases produced by combustion apply direct force to some component of the engine. 
This force is applied typically to pistons, turbine blades, or a nozzle. This 
force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into 
useful mechanical energy. 
  The term internal combustion engine usually refers to an engine in which 
combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke 
piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and 
the Wankel rotary engine. A second class of internal combustion engines use 
continuous combustion: gas turbines, jet engines and most rocket engines, each 
of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously 
described.
  The internal combustion engine (or ICE) is quite different from external 
combustion engines, such as steam or Stirling engines, in which the energy is 
delivered to a working fluid not consisting of, mixed with, or contaminated by 
combustion products. [from Wikipedia]")

watercraft. As well as providing propulsion, outboards provide steering control, 
as they are designed to pivot over their mountings and thus control the direction 
of thrust. The skeg also acts as a rudder when the engine is not running. 
Compared to inboard motors, outboard motors can be easily removed for storage or
