19th centuries which was fueled by Sunni prejudices against the Shi'i (thus 
attracting the help of the mostly Sunni Tajiks and Uzbeks) the Hazaras were 
driven to the barren dry mountains of central Afghanistan (the Hazarajat) 
where they live today separated into nine regionally distinct enclaves. The 
Hazaras are primarily sedentary farmers practicing some ancillary herding. 
Many Hazaras also migrated to the major towns, particularly Kabul where they 
occupied the lowest economic rungs. It is perhaps this economic deprivation 
which caused the Hazaras and other Shi'i to organize politically during the 
1960s and 1970s and concentrate on gaining political autonomy for themselves 
during the Soviet occupation. During the Soviet occupation, the Soviets 
abandoned any pretense of controlling the region. During this time, the 
Hazaras engaged in a violent civil war.")

over half the population. Tribally organized, the Pathan are concentrated in 
the east and the south. As they gained control over the rest of the country 
in the 19th century, however, many of them settled in other areas too. The 
Pashtuns mostly speak Pashtu (although some residing in Kabul and other urban 
areas speak Dari) and are generally Sunni Muslims. They are divided into 
tribal and sub-tribal groups to which they remain loyal. These tribal 
divisions have been the source of conflict among Pashtuns throughout their 
history. Even today, the Pashtun parties are divided along tribal lines. The 
majority of Pashtuns make their living off of animal husbandry and 
agriculture as well as some trade. In Afghanistan, Pashtuns have 
traditionally resided in a large semi-circular area following the Afghan 
border form north of the Darya-e-Morgab east and southward to just north of 
the 35' latitude. Enclaves of Pashtuns live scattered among other ethnic 
groups in much of the rest of the country, especially in the northern regions 
and in the western interior due to the resettlement policies of Amir Abdul 
Rahman Khan, who ruled Afghanistan from 1880 to 1901. From its founding in 
1747 by Ahmad Shah Durrani, Afghanistan has traditionally been dominated by 
the Pashtuns.")

Because they make up the bulk of Afghanistan's educated elite and possess 
considerable wealth, they have significant political influence. Their 
influence lies predominantly in the government ministries, public services

herding. They have no specific social structure and tend to adopt those of 
their neighbors. Slender and light skinned, the Tajiks have aquiline noses 
and usually black hair, although occasionally red and blond. Their history 
is vague, and it is possible that they were living in this area before the 
Aryan invasion. In Afghanistan, the Tajiks are the second largest group 
after the Pashtuns. They are also the Pashtuns' closest rivals for power 
and prestige. However, with two brief exceptions, one in the 14th century 
and one for nine months in 1929, they never ruled their region. They 
survived the Soviet occupation in a much less fragmented state than the

Kitui, Kwale, Meru, Mombasa, Mumias, Murang'a, Nairobi, Nakuru, North 
Kinangop, Ruiru, Sakwa. Schools under the Kenya Institute of Education (KIE) 
use a Kenyan version of (American) Exact Signed English, including one at 
Machakos. KSL is used at Nyangoma School at Bondo, a primary and boys' 
technical school (Sakwa), and in one girl's school. A school in Mombasa uses 
British Sign Language. Some Belgian brothers use Belgian Sign language in a 
school near Oyugis. 4 churches in Nairobi: 2 use KIE Signed English, 1 a 
mixture of that and KSL, the other uses a mixture of Korean, American, and 
Kenyan Sign Languages. Comments: Mainly unrelated to other sign languages. It 
has become standardized with slight variations since 1961, when elementary 
schools for deaf children were begun. The deaf from Kisumu (western Kenya) to 
the deaf in Mombasa (eastern Kenya) can understand each other completely even 
with some dialect differences. The deaf in Uganda and Tanzania do not really 
understand KSL, though they have much in common. Used in court cases involving
deaf people. The Kenya National Association of the Deaf, which has 12 
branches. The government is using KIE Signed English. The University of 
Nairobi backs KSL. Little research. Communication with those who do not know 
KSL is superficial only. KSL fits Kenyan culture and ties students back to

Alternate names: TETUM PRACA, DILI TETUM, TETUM DILI. Comments: Speakers of 
North and South Tetun [TTM] have significant difficulty understanding it in 
many speech domains, and vice versa. Some first language speakers of Tetum 
Prasa consider themselves to be bilingual in Tetun because of contact, but 
when pressed, admit there are domains in which communication is completely 
blocked. There are important differences with Tetun in parts of the grammar, 
morphology, functors, and much of the lexicon. There is heavy influence of 
Portuguese and some Indonesian or Malay loans in Tetum Prasa. Growing in its 
role as a language of wider communication, functioning as a symbol of 
inter-ethnic solidarity in the region, predominantly in urban areas. There 
are 3 second-language varieties spoken by different people: (1) fluent Tetum 
Prasa spoken throughout the western 2/3 of Timor Lorosae, primarily by those 
who have lived in Dili for one or more years, (2) occasional Dili residents 
with significant influence from their own local mother tongues, and (3) 
people originally from Timor Lorosae who are overseas residents in Portugal or 
Australia, with higher portion of inflected Portuguese vocabulary and almost 
complete lack of Indonesian or Malay loans. There is also 'Tetum Ibadat' or 
'liturgical Tetum' which is not spoken by anyone for everyday communication, 
nor as mother tongue, with a lot of vocabulary and some grammar that is not 
understood widely. Cultural rituals and themes in Tetun are not as deeply 
rooted in Tetum Prasa. Heavy Portuguese and Mambae influence. Language of 
wider communication. Compared to Tetun: many more Portuguese loan words; does 
not inflect V-initial verb roots for person or number; uses more 
periphrastic constructions than morphological constructions (e.g., 
causatives); differences in possessive constructions and negatives.

Standard Slovene. Speakers are bilingual or trilingual in the Slovenian 
dialect (Windisch), a German regional variety (Kärntnerisch or Steierisch), or
