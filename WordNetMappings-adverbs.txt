;; This is an annotated  version of the ADV.DAT file that is part of the 
;; WordNet 1.6 release.  Specifically, each record in the original file now 
;; includes an extra field at the end that indicates a related concept in 
;; the SUMO ontology.  This concept is designated with the prefix '&%'.  Note 
;; that each concept also has a suffix, viz. '=', '+' or '@', which indicates 
;; the precise relationship between the SUMO concept and the WordNet synset.  
;; The symbols '=', '+', and '@' mean, respectively, that the WordNet synset
;; is equivalent in meaning to the SUMO concept, is subsumed by the SUMO 
;; concept or is an instance of the SUMO concept.  More information about 
;; these mappings and the process of constructing them can be found in the 
;; paper "Aligning the SUMO with WordNet" (Niles, forthcoming).
