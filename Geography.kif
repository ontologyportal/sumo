are dependent upon growing in sunlight.  As a result, these corals are
usually found not far beneath the surface, although in clear waters corals
can grow at depths of 60 m (200 ft).  Corals breed by spawning, with all
corals of the same species in a region releasing gametes simultaneously
over a period of one to several nights around a full moon. (from Wikipedia)")
