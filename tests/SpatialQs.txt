(1), (2), (13) are from https://www.cosy.informatik.uni-bremen.de/sites/default/files/ByrneJohnson-Laird89.pdf

(1) A is on the right of B
    C is on the left of B
    Hence, A is on the right of C

(orientation A B Right)
(orientation C B Left)

(2) If x is on the right of y, and z is on the left of y, then x is on the right of z

(<=>
  (orientation ?OBJ1 ?OBJ2 Right)
  (orientation ?OBJ2 ?OBJ1 Left))

We may need to add:

(=>
  (and
    (orientation ?X ?Y Right)
    (orientation ?Z ?Y Left))
 (orientation ?X ?Z Right))

(13) A is on the right of B
     C is on the left of B
     D is in front of C
     E is in front of B.
       Therefore D is on the left of E

       a. Left (x,y> & Front (z, x) + Left (front
       (z, x), y), where the right-hand side signifies
       “z is in front of x, all of which is on the left
       of y.”
       b. Left (x, y) & Front (z, y) + Left (x,
       front (z, y)), where the right-hand side signifies “x is on the left of z which is in front
       of y.”
       c. Left (x, y) & Left (u, z) -+ Left (x, left
       6J3 z)).
       d. Left (x, y) * Right ty, x).
       e. Left (front (x, y), z) + Left (x, z) &
       Left (y, z) & Front (x, y).
       J Left (x, front (v, z)) -+ Left (x, y) &
       Left (x, z) & Front (y, z).
       g. Left (x, left (y, z)) + Left (x, y) & Left
       (x, z) 8~ Left 01, z).
       h. Left (x, y) + - Right (x, y).
       i. Right (x, y) + - Left (x, y).
