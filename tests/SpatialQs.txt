;; Spatial reasoning problems
;; starting with word problems, then later coding the formal query and solution in SUMO

(1), (2), (13) are from https://www.cosy.informatik.uni-bremen.de/sites/default/files/ByrneJohnson-Laird89.pdf

(1) A is on the right of B
    C is on the left of B
    Hence, A is on the right of C

(orientation A B Right)
(orientation C B Left)

need to add to SUMO:

(=>
  (and
    (orientation ?X ?Y ?R)
    (orientation ?Y ?Z ?R))
  (orientation ?X ?Z ?R))

proof will involve

(<=>
    (orientation ?OBJ1 ?OBJ2 Right)
    (orientation ?OBJ2 ?OBJ1 Left))

query: (orientation A C Right)

proof: (over tinySUMO.kif)

1. (not (orientation A C Right)) [] negated_conjecture

2. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2 ?VAR3 ?VAR4) (=> (and (orientation ?VAR3 ?VAR4 ?VAR1) (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR3 ?VAR1)) (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR4 ?VAR1))) [] kb_SUMO_2

5. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2 ?VAR3 ?VAR4) (or (or (orientation ?VAR4 ?VAR3 ?VAR2) (not (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR3 ?VAR2))) (not (orientation ?VAR4 ?VAR1 ?VAR2)))) [4] cnf_transformation

6. (forall (?VAR1) (or (not (orientation ?VAR1 C Right)) (not (orientation A ?VAR1 Right)))) [1, 5] resolution

7. (orientation A B Right) [] kb_SUMO_114

8. (not (orientation B C Right)) [6, 7] resolution

9. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2) (and (=> (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR1 Left) (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR2 Right)) (=> (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR2 Right) (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR1 Left)))) [] kb_SUMO_1

11. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2) (or (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR2 Right) (not (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR1 Left)))) [10] cnf_transformation

12. (not (orientation C B Left)) [8, 11] resolution

13. (orientation C B Left) [] kb_SUMO_115

14. false [12, 13] subsumption_resolution

(2) If x is on the right of y, and z is on the left of y, then x is on the right of z

(orientation X Y Right)
(orientation Z Y Left)

(<=>
  (orientation ?OBJ1 ?OBJ2 Right)
  (orientation ?OBJ2 ?OBJ1 Left))

We may need to add:

(=>
  (and
    (orientation ?X ?Y Right)
    (orientation ?Z ?Y Left))
 (orientation ?X ?Z Right))

query: (orientation X Z Right)

proof: (with tinySUMO)

1. (not (orientation X Z Right)) [] negated_conjecture

2. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2 ?VAR3) (=> (and (orientation ?VAR3 ?VAR2 Left) (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR2 Right)) (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR3 Right))) [] kb_SUMO_3

3. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2 ?VAR3) (or (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR3 Right) (not (orientation ?VAR3 ?VAR2 Left)) (not (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR2 Right)))) [2] ennf_transformation

5. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2 ?VAR3) (or (or (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR1 Right) (not (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR3 Left))) (not (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR3 Right)))) [4] cnf_transformation

6. (forall (?VAR1) (or (not (orientation Z ?VAR1 Left)) (not (orientation X ?VAR1 Right)))) [1, 5] resolution

7. (orientation Z Y Left) [] kb_SUMO_118

8. (not (orientation X Y Right)) [6, 7] resolution

9. (orientation X Y Right) [] kb_SUMO_117

10. false [8, 9] subsumption_resolution
