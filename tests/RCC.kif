;Two houses are connected via a road.
; Each house is located on an own property.
; The first house possibly touches the boundary of the property;
; the second one surely does not.
; What can we infer about the relation of the second property to the road?

; The spatial configuration can be formalized in RCC8 as the following constraint network:

(instance House1 SingleFamilyResidence)
(instance House2 SingleFamilyResidence)

(instance Property1 GeographicArea)
(instance Property2 GeographicArea)

(instance Road1 Road)

;house1 DC house2

(discrete House1 House2)

;house1 {TPP, NTPP} property1

(tangentialProperPart House1 Property1)

; how could it also be a non tangential proper part?

;house1 {DC, EC} property2

(discrete House1 Property2)
(meetsSpatially House1 Property2)

;house1 EC road

(meetsSpatially House1 Road1)

;house2 { DC, EC } property1

(discrete House2 Property1)
(meetsSpatially House2 Property1)

;house2 NTPP property2

(nonTangentialProperPart House2 Property2)

;house2 EC road

(meetsSpatially House2 Road1)

;property1 { DC, EC } property2

(discrete Property1 Property2)
(meetsSpatially Property1 Property2)

;road { DC, EC, TPP, TPPi, PO, EQ, NTPP, NTPPi } property1

(discrete Road1 Property1)
(meetsSpatially Road1 Property1)
(tangentialProperPart Road1 Property1)
(tangentialProperPart Property1 Road1)
(partiallyOverlaps Road1 Property1)
; this doesn't make sense (equals Road1 Property1)
(nonTangentialProperPart Road1 Property1)
(nonTangentialProperPart Property1 Road1)

;road { DC, EC, TPP, TPPi, PO, EQ, NTPP, NTPPi } property2

(discrete Road1 Property2)
(meetsSpatially Road1 Property2)
(tangentialProperPart Road1 Property2)
(tangentialProperPart Property2 Road1)
(partiallyOverlaps Road1 Property2)
; this doesn't make sense (equals Road1 Property2)
(nonTangentialProperPart Road1 Property2)
(nonTangentialProperPart Property2 Road1)

;Using the RCC8 composition table and the path-consistency algorithm,
;we can refine the network in the following way:

;road { PO, EC } property1

(partiallyOverlaps Road1 Property1)
(meetsSpatially Road1 Property1)

;road { PO, TPP } property2

(partiallyOverlaps Road1 Property2)
(tangentialProperPart Road1 Property2)

;That is, the road either overlaps (PO) property2, or is a tangential proper part of it.
;But, if the road is a tangential proper part of property2,
;then the road can only be externally connected (EC) to property1.
;That is, road PO property1 is not possible when road TPP property2.
;This fact is not obvious, but can be deduced once we examine the
;consistent "singleton-labelings" of the constraint network.
;The following paragraph briefly describes singleton-labelings.
