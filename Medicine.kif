When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague, such as tiredness, weakness,
shortness of breath, headaches, and a reduced ability to exercise. When anemia is
acute, symptoms may include confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, loss
of consciousness, and increased thirst. Anemia must be significant before a person
becomes noticeably pale. Symptoms of anemia depend on how quickly hemoglobin
decreases. Additional symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause.
Preoperative anemia can increase the risk of needing a blood transfusion following
surgery. Anemia can be temporary or long term and can range from mild to severe.

&%BloodCirculation and &%Breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest. It is recommended for those who are
unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal &%Breathing, for example, agonal respirations.
CPR involves chest compressions for adults between 5 cm (2.0 in) and 6 cm (2.4 in) deep and at a rate of
at least 100 to 120 per minute. The rescuer may also provide artificial ventilation by either &%Exhaling
air into the subject's mouth or &%Nose (mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) or using a device that pushes air into
the subject's &%Lungs (mechanical ventilation). Current recommendations place emphasis on early and high-
quality chest compressions over artificial ventilation; a simplified CPR method involving only chest
compressions is recommended for untrained rescuers.
CPR alone is unlikely to restart the heart. Its main purpose is to restore the partial flow of oxygenated
blood to the &%Brain and &%Heart. The objective is to delay &%Tissue &%Death and to extend the brief window of
opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent &%Brain damage. Administration of an electric

increases. In severe hypothermia, there may be hallucinations and paradoxical undressing, in

The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and voluntary physical
activity. In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids
are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe
hypothermia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful.

Staphylococcus was one of the leading infections in hospitals and many strains of this bacterium have become antibiotic resistant. Despite strong attempts to get rid of them, staph bacteria stay present in hospitals, where they can infect people who are most at risk of infection.[4]
Staphylococcus includes at least 43 species. Of these, nine have two subspecies, one has three subspecies, and one has four subspecies.[5] Many species cannot cause disease and reside normally on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and other animals. Staphylococcus species have been found to be nectar-inhabiting microbes.[6] They are also a small component of the soil microbiome.[7]")

result of alcoholism, long-term diarrhea, carcinoid syndrome, Hartnup

post-synthesis modification of certain proteins that are required for
blood coagulation (K from koagulation, Danish for 'coagulation') or
for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The
complete synthesis involves final modification of these so-called 'Gla
proteins' by the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase that uses vitamin K
as a cofactor. The presence of uncarboxylated proteins indicates a
vitamin K deficiency. Carboxylation allows them to bind (chelate)
calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K,
blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding
occurs. Research suggests that deficiency of vitamin K may also weaken
bones, potentially contributing to osteoporosis, and may promote
calcification of arteries and other soft tissues.[from Wikipedia]")

(documentation Asthma EnglishLanguage "Asthma is a long-term
inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is
characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow
obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms. Symptoms
include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness
of breath. These may occur a few times a day or a few times per
week. Depending on the person, asthma symptoms may become worse at
night or with exercise. Asthma is thought to be caused by a
combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental
factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other
potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta
blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms,
response to therapy over time, and spirometry lung function
testing. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of
symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak
expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or
non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a
type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.[from Wikipedia]")

"Electrocardiography is the process of producing a graph of voltage
versus time of the electrical activity of the &%Heart using
electrodes placed on the &%Skin. These electrodes detect the small
electrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle
depolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle
(heartbeat). Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous
cardiac abnormalities, including cardiac rhythm disturbances (such as
atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), inadequate
coronary artery blood flow (such as myocardial ischemia and
myocardial infarction), and electrolyte disturbances (such as
hypokalemia and hyperkalemia). In a conventional 12-lead ECG,
ten electrodes are placed on the patient's limbs and on the surface of
the chest. The overall magnitude of the heart's electrical potential
is then measured from twelve different angles ('leads') and is
recorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds). In this way, the
overall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical
depolarization is captured at each moment throughout the cardiac
cycle.[from Wikipedia].")

is a &%GramNegative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped,
coliform &%Bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in
the lower &%Intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most
E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes (EPEC, ETEC etc.) can
cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally
responsible for food contamination incidents that prompt product
recalls. The harmless strains are part of the normal microbiota
of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2,
(which helps blood to clot) and preventing colonisation of the
intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a mutualistic
relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within
&%Feces. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter
under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly
afterwards.[from Wikipedia]")

&%Opium, a dark brown resin produced by drying the latex of opium poppies (Papaver somniferum).
It is mainly used as a &%Pain medication, and is also commonly used recreationally, or to make
other illicit opioids. There are numerous methods used to administer morphine: oral; sublingual;
via inhalation; injection into a &%Muscle, injection under the &%Skin, or injection into the
&%SpinalCord area; transdermal; or via rectal suppository. It acts directly on the central nervous
system (CNS) to induce analgesia and alter perception and emotional response to pain. Physical
and psychological dependence and tolerance may develop with repeated administration. It can
be taken for both acute pain and chronic pain and is frequently used for pain from &%HeartAttack,
kidney stones, and during labor. Its maximum effect is reached after about 20
minutes when administered intravenously and 60 minutes when administered by &%Mouth, while the
duration of its effect is 3–7 hours.[from Wikipedia]")
