in which the source material is heated, a condenser in which the heated 
&%Gas is cooled back to the liquid state, and a receiver in which the 
concentrated or purified liquid is collected.  The equipment may effect 
separation by one of two main methods.  Firstly the vapours given off by 
the heated mixture may consist of two liquids with significantly different 
boiling points.  Thus, the vapour that is given off is in the vast 
majority of one or the other liquid, which after condensation and 
collection effects the separation.  The second method (fractional 
distillation) relies upon a gradient of temperatures existing in the 
condenser stage of the equipment.  Often in this technique, a vertical 
condenser, or column, is used.  By extracting products that are liquid at 
different heights up the column, it is possible to extract liquids that 
have different boiling points.  (from Wikipedia)")
