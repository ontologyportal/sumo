The main site for SUMO is http://www.ontologyportal.org

This directory contains knowledge base files written in KIF, and files in WordNet
data file format (see <https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation/wndb5wn>).
Several alternative WordNet mapping files are present.


This directory also contains a subdirectory called "Translations" which contains the
natural language format files for languages other than English.

Files of knowledge that are new and immature belong in the "development" subdirectory.

There are many videos about SUMO at https://www.youtube.com/@adampease/ to help with learning how to use and extend SUMO.
