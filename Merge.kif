;; Working Group.

;; The SUMO incorporates elements of John Sowa's upper ontology (as described at 
;; http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/toplevel.htm and in Chapter 2 of his 
;; book _Knowledge Representation_, Brooks/Cole, 2000), Russell and Norvig's 
;; ontology, PSL (Process Specification Language), Casati and Varzi's theory of 
;; holes, Allen's temporal axioms, the relatively noncontroversial elements of 
;; Smith's and Guarino's respective mereotopologies, the KIF formalization of the 
;; CPR (Core Plan Representation), the ontologies available on the Ontolingua 
;; server maintained by Stanford University's Knowledge Systems Laboratory, the 
;; ontologies developed by ITBM-CNR, some of the spatial relations from an 
;; unpublished paper by Iris Tommelein and Anil Gupta entitled "Conceptual 
;; Structures for Spatial Reasoning", and a "Structural Ontology" proposed by 
;; David Whitten and substantially revised and extended by Chris Menzel.
;; Note that some of the subclasses of 'Process' in the SUMO were originally 
;; inspired by some of the verb classes from the second part of Beth Levin's book 
;; "English Verb Classes and Alternations:  A Preliminary Investigation."

;; The knowledge representation language in which the SUMO is expressed is SUO-KIF, 
;; which stands for "Standard Upper Ontology - Knowledge Interchange Format".  SUO-KIF 
;; is a simplified form of the popular KIF knowledge representation language.  A 
;; specification of SUO-KIF can be found at:  http://suo.ieee.org/suo-kif.html.  It 
;; should be noted that some of the axioms in the SUMO make use of row variables 
;; (indicated with a "@" prefix).  Such variables are not currently part of the SUO-
;; KIF specification, but they simplify matters significantly in some cases.  Details 
;; about row variables can be found in the following paper:  
;; http://reliant.teknowledge.com/IJCAI01/HayesMenzel-SKIF-IJCAI2001.pdf.

;; The SUMO is a modular ontology.  That is, the ontology is divided into 
;; self-contained subontologies.  Each subontology is indicated by a section 
;; header, and the dependencies between the subontologies are specified with 
;; statements of the form ";; INCLUDES '<SUBONTOLOGY>'".  These statements are 
;; found at the beginning of each section.  The dependencies between the 
;; various subontologies can also be graphed as follows:

;; Note that the "+" sign at the end of an arc indicates the direction of 
;; dependency - the node near the sign includes the subontology at the other 
;; end of the arc.  Note too that in some cases the dependency is 
;; bidirectional.  Separating ontologies in cases like these is useful when 
;; their respective topics can be cleanly differentiated.

(documentation Sievert "SI dose equivalent measure.  Symbol: Sv.  It is 
a unit of biologic dose of ionizing radiation.  The &%Sievert makes it 
possible to normalize doses of different types of radiation. It takes 
into account the relative biologic effectiveness of ionizing radiation, 
since each form of such radiation--e.g., X rays, gamma rays, neutrons--
has a slightly different effect on living tissue for a given absorbed 
dose. The dose equivalent of a given type of radiation (in &%Sievert) is 
the dose of the radiation in &%Gray multiplied by a quality factor that 
is based on the relative biologic effectiveness of the radiation. 
Accordingly, one &%Sievert is generally defined as the amount of radiation 
roughly equivalent in biologic effectiveness to one &%Gray of gamma 
radiation.  &%Sievert = J/kg = m^2*s^(-2)")

;;  This section is not a subontology of the SUMO.  It contains axioms from 
;;  other sections of the ontology that may cause problems for an inference 
;;  engine.  In particular, they can be used to construct arbitrarily complex 
;;  terms that often appear in proofs with unhelpful conclusions.  Before this 
;;  file is loaded into the inference engine, the axioms in this section should 
;;  be commented out.
