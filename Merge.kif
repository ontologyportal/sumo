;; The knowledge representation language in which the SUMO is expressed is SUO-KIF,
;; which stands for "Standard Upper Ontology - Knowledge Interchange Format".  SUO-KIF
;; is a simplified form of the KIF knowledge representation language.  A
;; specification of SUO-KIF can be found at:  http://www.ontologyportal.org

;; The SUMO is a modular ontology.  That is, the ontology is divided into 
;; self-contained subontologies.  Each subontology is indicated by a section
;; header, and the dependencies between the subontologies are specified with 
;; statements of the form ";; INCLUDES '<SUBONTOLOGY>'".  These statements are 
;; found at the beginning of each section.  

;; We ask that people using or referencing SUMO cite our primary paper:

;; Niles, I., and Pease, A.  2001.  Towards a Standard Upper Ontology.  In

instrument-measured sound levels in an effort to account for the relative
loudness perceived by the human ear, as the ear is less sensitive to low audio
frequencies. It is employed by arithmetically adding a table of values, listed
by octave or third-octave bands, to the measured sound pressure levels in dB.
The resulting octave band measurements are usually added (logarithmic method) to
provide a single A-weighted value describing the sound; the units are written as
dB(A).[from Wikipedia]")
