parasitic arachnids that are part of the superorder Parasitiformes.
Along with mites, they constitute the subclass Acari. Adult ticks are
approximately 3 to 5 mm in length depending on age, sex, species, and
'fullness'. Ticks are external parasites, living by feeding on the
blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. The
timing of the origin of ticks is uncertain, though the oldest known
tick fossils are from the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years
old. Ticks are widely distributed around the world, especially in
warm, humid climates. [from Wikipedia]")
