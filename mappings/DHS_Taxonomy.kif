(documentation Taxonomy "A &%Taxonomy is a &%ClassificationScheme
that typically includes the salient concepts of a domain of
interest, plus, minimally, a binary `broader than'/`narrower
than' relation by which the concepts are linked.  The `broader
than'/`narrower than' relation is usually conceived as set- or
class-based subsumption, but taxonomies are notorious for
conflating the set membership and set subsumption (i.e.,
subset/superset) relations into a single `IS-A' relation.  Some
taxonomies include additional binary relations, such as
`subpart'/`superpart'.")

an ontology typically includes multiple taxonomies.")
