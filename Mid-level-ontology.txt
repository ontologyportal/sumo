;; This is the source file for the MILO (MId-Level Ontology), an ontology that 
;; is being developed as a bridge between the abstract content of the SUMO and 
;; the rich detail of the various Teknowledge domain ontologies.  The MILO is 
;; at this point in time (April 2003) provisional and incomplete.  It will be 
;; actively modified and greatly enlarged at least through the end of 2003.  
;; Those who are interested in making use of this ontology are urged 
;; to contact Adam Pease (apease@ks.teknowledge.com) or Ian Niles 
;; (iniles@teknowledge.com) for the latest version.

grammar structure that allow for communication as rich and complex as that of 
non-creole languages. While pidgins are regarded as reduced languages, creoles
are considered expanded languages. That is, while pidgins develop to enable 
communication in relatively isolated domains, creoles allow for a full range 
of expressive possibilities on a par with more 'recognized' languages.")

(documentation PidginLanguage "A &%PidginLanguage is not the native language 
of anyone but is used as an auxiliary or supplemental language between two 
mutually unintelligible speech communities. Pidgins are reduced languages, 
characterized by having a limited vocabulary and a simple grammar which serve 
to satisfy basic communication needs. Historically these languages have 
primarily arisen in trade centers and plantations (with slaves from different 
language backgrounds), areas where large groups of people lacking a common 
language need to communicate. By definition, a pidgin has no native speakers; 
it is always a person's second (or more) language.")
