in response to the intensity of light that falls on the retinal ganglion cells 
of the retina in the back of the eye, thereby assisting the adaptation of vision 
to various level of lightness/darkness. A greater intensity of the light causes
the pupil to constrict; whereas a lower intensity of light causes the pupil to
dilate. Thus the pupillary light reflex regualtes the intensity of the light 
entering the eye. Light shone into one eye will cause both pupils to constrict.
