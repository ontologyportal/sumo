(subclass USWarrantOfficerRank CommissionedOfficerRank)
(documentation USWarrantOfficerRank EnglishLanguage "In the United States military, a 
warrant officer was originally, and strictly, a highly skilled, 
single-track specialty officer.  But as many chief warrant officers assume
positions as officer in charge or department head, along with the high 
number of bachelor's and master's degrees held within the community, their 
contribution and expertise as a community is ever-increasing.  There are
no 'warrant officers' per se in the U.S.  Navy, but rather the term 'chief 
warrant officer' is correct.  In the U.S.  Navy, a sailor must be in one 
of the top three enlisted ranks to be eligible to become a Chief Warrant 
Officer.  In the U.S.  Army, a person can progress to the warrant officer 
rank at a grade lower than E-7 thus having a longer career and greater 
opportunity to serve and grow.  In the U.S.  Marine Corps, after serving 
at least eight years of enlisted service, and reaching the grade of E-5 
(sergeant), an enlisted Marine can apply for the Warrant Officer program.  
Upon the initial appointment to WO1 a warrant is given by the secretary of 
the service, and upon promotion to chief warrant officer (CW2 and above) 
they are commissioned by the President of the United States, take the same 
oath and receive the same commission and charges as commissioned officers, 
thus deriving their authority from the same source.")

nomenclature varies by nationality and by branch of arms, e.g.  some 
armies organize their infantry into battalions, but call battalion-sized
cavalry, reconnaissance, or tank units a squadron or a regiment instead.  
There may even be subtle distinctions within a nation's branches of arms, 
such a distinction between a tank battalion and an armored squadron, 
depending on how the unit's operational role is perceived to fit into the 
army's historical organization.  A battalion is potentially the smallest 
military unit capable of independent operations (i.e.  not attached to a 
higher command), but is usually part of a regiment or a brigade or both, 
depending on the organizational model used by that service.  Battalions 
are ordinarily homogeneous with respect to type (e.g.  an infantry 
battalion or a tank battalion), although there are occasional 
exceptions. (from Wikipedia)")
