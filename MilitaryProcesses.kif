(documentation SpecialReconnaissance EnglishLanguage "These are reconnaissance and
surveillance actions conducted as a special operation in hostile,
denied, or politically sensitive environments to collect or verify
information of strategic or operational significance, employing
military capabilities not normally found in conventional forces. These
actions provide an additive capability for commanders and supplement
other conventional reconnaissance and surveillance actions. Even with
today's sophisticated long-range sensors and overhead platforms, some
information can be obtained only by visual observation or other
collection methods in the target area. SOF's highly developed
capabilities of gaining access to denied and hostile areas, worldwide
communications, and specialized aircraft and sensors enable SR against
targets inaccessible to other forces or assets. Activities within SR
include the following:

(1) Environmental Reconnaissance. These are operations conducted to
collect and report critical hydrographic, geological, and
meteorological information.

(2) Armed Reconnaissance. These are operations that involve locating
and attacking targets of opportunity, e.g., adversary materiel,
personnel, and facilities in assigned general areas or along assigned
LOCs. Armed reconnaissance is not conducted for the purpose of
attacking specific identified targets.

(3) Target and Threat Assessment. These are operations conducted to
detect, identify, locate, and assess a target to determine the most
effective employment of weapons. This type of operation might include
the assessment of the potential effects (to include collateral damage)
of a strike or an attack on a chemical, biological, radiological,
nuclear, or toxic industrial material site.

(4) Poststrike Reconnaissance. These operations are undertaken for the
purpose of gathering information used to measure results of a
strike.")

equipped, supported, and directed in varying degrees by an external
source. UW is unique in that it is a SO that can either be conducted
as part of a geographic combatant commander's overall theater
campaign, or as an independent, subordinate campaign.
When conducted independently, the primary focus of UW is on
political-military objectives and psychological objectives. UW
includes military and paramilitary aspects of resistance movements. UW
military activity represents the culmination of a successful effort to
organize and mobilize the civil populace against a hostile government
or occupying power. From the US perspective, the intent is to develop
and sustain these supported resistance organizations and to
synchronize their activities to further US national security
objectives. SOF units do not create resistance movements. They advise,
train, and assist indigenous resistance movements already in existence
to conduct UW and when required, accompany them into combat. When UW
operations support conventional military operations, the focus shifts
to primarily military objectives - however the political and
psychological implications remain. Operational and strategic staffs
and commanders must guard against limiting UW to a specific set of
circumstances or activities defined by either recent events or
personal experience. The most prevalent mistake is the belief that UW

exploit, recover, or damage designated targets. DA differs from
conventional offensive actions in the level of physical and political
risk, operational techniques, and the degree of discriminate and
precise use of force to achieve specific objectives. Activities within
DA include the following:

(1) Raids, Ambushes, and Direct Assaults. These are operations
designed to achieve specific, well-defined and often time-sensitive
results. They are sometimes beyond the effective strike capabilities
of conventional force elements. Such operations typically involve
attacks on critical targets, interdiction of LOCs or other target
systems, capturing designated personnel or material, or the seizure,
destruction, or neutralization of adversary facilities or
capabilities.

(2) Standoff Attacks. These are attacks by weapon systems or through
IO. Standoff attacks can be conducted by air, maritime, or by ground
platforms or units. When targets can be sufficiently damaged or
destroyed without the commitment of close-combat forces, these attacks
can be performed as independent actions.

(3) Terminal Attack Control and Terminal Guidance Operations. These
are actions to identify and precisely report the location of targets,
and with global positioning systems, laser designators, beacons, or
other means, conduct either terminal attack control (TAC) or terminal
guidance operations (TGO) to effectively engage them. TAC involves
actions to control the maneuver of and grant weapons release clearance
to attacking aircraft. TGO includes any electronic, mechanical, voice
or visual communication that provides approaching aircraft or weapons
additional information regarding a specific location or target. TAC
differs from TGO in that TAC includes the authority to clear aircraft
to release ordnance and TGO does not. Because of this, TAC requires
individuals to be qualified as joint terminal attack controllers, but
TGO does not.

(4) Recovery Operations. These are operations conducted to search for,
locate, identify, rescue, and return personnel, sensitive equipment,
or items critical to national security. SO recovery missions are
characterized by detailed planning, rehearsal, and thorough
intelligence analysis. These operations employ unconventional tactics
and techniques, clandestine search, possible indigenous assistance,
and the frequent use of ground combat elements.

(5) Precision Destruction Operations. These are operations in which
collateral damage must be minimized, requiring highly sophisticated
weapons and/or timed detonation of specific amounts of explosives
placed in exact locations to accomplish mission objectives. Precision
destruction operations can be conducted against targets where
precision-guided munitions cannot guarantee first strike success or
when the contents of a facility must be destroyed without damage to
that facility.

(6) Anti-Surface Operations. These are operations conducted against
adversary maritime surface targets, including combatants. These
include, but are not limited to, visit, board, search, and seizure
operations which are shipboarding operations to board and seize
cooperative, uncooperative, or hostile contacts of interest.")

(documentation PsychologicalOperation EnglishLanguage "These are planned operations
that convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences
to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and
ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups,
and individuals. The purpose of PSYOP is to induce or reinforce
foreign attitudes and behaviors favorable to the JFC's
objectives. Planning and employment considerations include:

(1) Force Multiplier. PSYOP are among the most effective nonlethal
weapons available to a commander. It can reduce casualties on both
sides by reducing the morale and combat effectiveness of the
adversary, creating dissent and disaffection within their ranks,
encouraging surrenders or defections, promoting disobedience, or
inducing a lack of support for a hostile regime within a civilian
populace.

(2) Combatant Commander Responsibilities. Each geographic combatant
commander is responsible for conducting PSYOP programs in
peacetime. Such efforts are designed to create a favorable image of
the friendly government, of the United States, and of the Armed Forces
of the United States, encourage support for democratic institutions,
human rights, regional stability, and counterdrug activities, and
assist a HN in explaining and publicizing humanitarian and civic
action projects to local citizens. When used as part of an integrated
theater strategy or strategic information operation, PSYOP can reduce
the probability of conflict, reduce the damage if conflict does occur,
and speed the transition to normality in the postconflict phase.

(3) PSYOP Applications. Taking advantage of their language and culture
skills, in-depth knowledge of the region, and understanding of
interagency operations, SOF provide the geographic combatant commander
with a broad range of PSYOP capabilities to be employed independently
or in support of a larger theater campaign. These capabilities include
the following:

(a) Developing, Producing, Distributing, and Disseminating. PSYOP
units design, develop, and produce programs. They distribute and
disseminate products that support tactical, operational, and strategic
goals.

(b) Coordinating and Directing PSYOP Programs. PSYOP support national
policy goals with programs developed for and approved by higher
authority. PSYOP personnel coordinate with the chain of command to
ensure the credibility and effectiveness of the program.

(c) Producing PSYOP Studies and Estimates. PSYOP personnel produce and
maintain studies and estimates for the commander. They advise
supported commanders on the expected psychological impacts of their
courses of action (COAs). They identify the adversary PSYOP effort and
the susceptibilities of friendly forces.

(d) Support Enemy Prisoner of War (EPW), Civilian Internee (CI), and
Dislocated Civilian (DC) Operations. PSYOP support can dispel rumors,
create dialogue and pacify or indoctrinate EPWs, CIs, or DCs to
minimize violence, facilitate efficient camp operations, and ensure
safe and humane conditions persist.

(e) Providing Support to HN Assistance Operations. During CMO, PSYOP
personnel may work with CA or conventional units to promote civic
action projects either by or in support of the host government.

(f) Employ Tactical PSYOP. Tactical PSYOP forces, with augmentation,
are capable of providing all functions of PSYOP, on a limited scale,
to component commands within a designated area of operations (AO).

(4) PSYOP Support to Information Operations. PSYOP are a core
capability of IO. PSYOP activities are integrated into IO plans and
synchronized with IO objectives and themes. Mission-type orders and
decentralized execution can give PSYOP forces considerable autonomy to
conduct tactical operations within established IO guidance. For
additional information on PSYOP, see JP 3-53, Doctrine for Joint
Psychological Operations.
