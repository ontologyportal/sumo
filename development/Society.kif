; 2.Drink infobox templates (3 C, 6 P) Drinking in Merge.kif 8244-8245, Beverage Merge.kif 12107-12108, BeverageProduct Economy.kif 4296-4297

; 6.Military infobox templates (3 C, 19 P) Have several ontologies on that,  need tidying up (feature request in SF, "admiral" is the example)
; 7.Numismatics infobox templates (6 P) below, characterized in WN mappings as a field of study
