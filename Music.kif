professional musicians, called kitharodes. The kithara's origins are likely
Asiatic. The barbiton was a bass version of the kithara popular in the eastern
Aegean and ancient Asia Minor. In the Middle Ages, cythara was also used
generically for stringed instruments including lyres, but also including
lute-like instruments.[4][5] The use of the name throughout the Middle Ages

1924, then declined as the improvement in phonograph recordings due to
electrical recording methods developed in the mid-1920s. The advent of
electrical amplification in home music reproduction via radio in the same period
helped cause their eventual decline in popularity, and the stock market crash of
