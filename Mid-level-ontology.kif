;; &%Dead to &%Organism and &%HumanCorpse probably result in

;; that make it possible to express the same distinctions of
;; meaning all seem about equally awkward.  In the approach
;; chosen here, Organism and OrganismRemains are conceived
;; as temporally disjoint.  It would be a mistake to apply
;; Dead to an instance of Organism for any time interval,
;; and a mistake to apply Living to an instance of
;; OrganismRemains for any time interval.  In other words,
;; in this approach there are no Dead Organisms, only Living

;; all of the objects that play any role in a Process,

;; &%patient to mean "every case role in a Process that is

Polystyrene is one of the most widely used plastics, the scale of its production being several billion kilograms per year. Polystyrene can be naturally transparent, but can be colored with colorants. Uses include protective packaging (such as packing peanuts and CD and DVD cases), containers (such as 'clamshells'), lids, bottles, trays, tumblers, and disposable cutlery.

As a thermoplastic polymer, polystyrene is in a solid (glassy) state at room temperature but flows if heated above about 100 °C, its glass transition temperature. It becomes rigid again when cooled. This temperature behavior is exploited for extrusion, and also for molding and vacuum forming, since it can be cast into molds with fine detail.

It is very slow to biodegrade and therefore a focus of controversy, since it is often abundant as a form of litter in the outdoor environment, particularly along shores and waterways especially in its foam form. (Wikipedia)")
