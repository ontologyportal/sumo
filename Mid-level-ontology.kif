;; NS: The diagram below depicts the temporal relationships
;; between the main attributes and classes mentioned above,
;; as applied to one instance of Organism.  Before it is the
;; experiencer of its Death, an Organism X has the
;; BiologicalAttribute Living.  X's Death has as its result
;; a new instance of OrganismRemains, Y, which consists of
;; the same material (parts) as the previously existing
;; Organism X.

;;
;; |----- Organism X -------|-- OrganismRemains Y -->???|

;; The distinction between "existing" as a chunk of more or
;; less organism-shaped matter and simply being Dead (having
;; experienced death), as well as the temporal aspects, make
;; this all seem excessively difficult, but alternatives
;; that make it possible to express the same distinctions of
;; meaning all seem about equally awkward.  In the approach
;; chosen here, Organism and OrganismRemains are conceived
;; as temporally disjoint.  It would be a mistake to apply
;; Dead to an instance of Organism for any time interval,
;; and a mistake to apply Living to an instance of
;; OrganismRemains for any time interval.  In other words,
;; in this approach there are no Dead Organisms, only Living
;; Organisms or Dead OrganismRemains.

"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of progressive
lung disease that is preventable and treatable. COPD is characterized
by long-term respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. The main
symptoms include shortness of breath and a cough which may or may not
produce mucus. COPD progressively worsens with everyday activities
such as walking or dressing becoming difficult. The two most common
conditions of COPD are &%Emphysema and &%ChronicBronchitis, and they have
been the two classic COPD phenotypes. Emphysema is just one of
the structural abnormalities that can limit airflow and can exist
without airflow limitation in a significant number of people.
Chronic bronchitis does not always result in airflow limitation but in
young adults who smoke the risk of developing COPD is high. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis remain the
predominant phenotypes of COPD but there is often overlap between
them, and a number of other phenotypes have also been
described. The most common cause of COPD is tobacco smoking.
Other risk factors include indoor and outdoor pollution, exposure to
occupational irritant substances such as dust from grains, and cadmium
dust or fumes, and genetics. In developing countries, common
sources of indoor air pollution are the use of coal, and biomass such
as wood and dry dung as fuel for cooking and heating. Most
people living in European cities are exposed to damaging levels of air
pollution. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by
spirometry. [from Wikipedia")

dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. The severity
of the condition is variable. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection
with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms.
Identifying the responsible pathogen can be difficult. Diagnosis is
often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-rays, blood
tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The
disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community-
or hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia.[from

which refers to loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure in
certain activities that usually bring joy to people. Depressed mood
is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder
or dysthymia; it is a normal temporary reaction to life events,
such as the loss of a loved one; and it is also a symptom of some
physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical
treatments. It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and
concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and
time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings
of dejection, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. It can either be

monophosphate (AMP). Other processes regenerate ATP so that the human

monoclonal antibodies can also be engineered, by increasing the

As with most common names, the application of the word is arbitrary, since the larvae of sawflies are commonly called caterpillars as well.[1][2] Both lepidopteran and symphytan larvae have eruciform body shapes.
Caterpillars of most species eat plant material (often leaves), but not all; some (about 1%) eat insects, and some are even cannibalistic. Some feed on other animal products. For example, clothes moths feed on wool, and horn moths feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates.
Caterpillars are typically voracious feeders and many of them are among the most serious of agricultural pests. In fact, many moth species are best known in their caterpillar stages because of the damage they cause to fruits and other agricultural produce, whereas the moths are obscure and do no direct harm. Conversely, various species of caterpillar are valued as sources of silk, as human or animal food, or for biological control of pest plants.[from Wikipedia].")

large horn. They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment

lack teeth at the front of their mouths, relying instead on their lips to pluck

(documentation Reindeer EnglishLanguage "The reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), also
known as caribou in North America, is a species of deer with circumpolar
distribution, native to arctic, subarctic, tundra, boreal, and mountainous
regions of northern Europe, Siberia, and North America. This includes both
sedentary and migratory populations. While overall widespread and numerous,
some of its subspecies are rare and at least one has already become
extinct. For this reason, it is considered to be vulnerable by the IUCN.
Reindeer vary considerably in colour and size. Both sexes can grow antlers
annually, although the proportion of females that grow antlers varies greatly
between population and season. Antlers are typically larger on males. Hunting
of wild reindeer and herding of semi-domesticated reindeer (for meat, hides,
antlers, milk and transportation) are important to several Arctic and Subarctic
peoples. In Lapland, reindeer pull pulks. In traditional festive legend,
Santa Claus's reindeer pull a sleigh through the night sky to help Santa Claus
deliver gifts to children on Christmas Eve. [Wikipedia]")

true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in
Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are
considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. The term
crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae.
The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of
the order Crocodilia, which includes Tomistoma, the alligators and caimans
(family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living
and fossil Crocodylomorpha. [Wikipedia]")

(documentation Cheetah EnglishLanguage "The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus)
is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae that occurs mainly in eastern and
southern Africa and a few parts of Iran. The only extant member of the genus
Acinonyx, the cheetah was first described by Johann Christian Daniel von
Schreber in 1775. The cheetah is characterised by a slender body, deep chest,
spotted coat, a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, long
thin legs and a long spotted tail. Its lightly built, slender form is in sharp
contrast with the robust build of the big cats, making it more similar to the
cougar. The cheetah reaches nearly 70 to 90 cm (28 to 35 in) at the shoulder,
and weighs 21–72 kg (46–159 lb). Though taller than the leopard, it is notably
smaller than the lion. Basically yellowish tan or rufous to greyish white, the
coat is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. [Wikipedia]")

including a 13 cm (5.1 in) tail, weigh about 1.5–4 pounds (0.7–2 kg), and have a
natural lifespan of 7 to 10 years. Ferrets are sexually dimorphic predators with
males being substantially larger than females. Several other Mustelids also have
the word ferret in their common names, including an endangered species, the
black-footed ferret. Distinct from the nearly extinct wild American ferret. [Wikipedia]")

belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia. Despite their common name,
these animals are not in the pig family Suidae, nor do they come from Guinea.
They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and
hybridization suggest they are domesticated descendants of a closely related
species of cavy such as Cavia aperea, C. fulgida, or C. tschudii and, therefore,
do not exist naturally in the wild. Recent studies applying molecular
markers, in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of
current and mummified animals, revealed that the ancestor is most likely
Cavia tschudii. [Wikipedia]")
