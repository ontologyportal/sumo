;; NS: The KR above is inadequate for several reasons: (1)

;; &%before must be used with TimePoints, not TimeIntervals;
;; and (3) Axioms that apply the attributes &%Living and
;; &%Dead to &%Organism and &%HumanCorpse probably result in
;; unintended conclusions.  Consider rule [4], above, in
;; conjuction with rules [5] and [6], below, both of which
;; appear in Merge.kif:

;; TO DO: 
;;
;; 1. Delete axioms [1] - [4], above, which already are
;;    commented out.
;;

;;
;; 3. In Merge.kif, rewrite [5] to avoid concluding that
;;    Organisms can be Dead.  (already done.)
;;
;; 4. Apparently, the intent of rule [3], above, is to
;;    represent the state of most &%Dead &%Humans in a
;;    rather short time interval following death, when the
;;    body is still an intact, integral whole, and
;;    embalming, cremation, mummification, or burial have
;;    not yet occurred.  Add the section below, which tries
;;    to address the presumed intent of [1] - [4], but also

;; The distinction between "existing" as a chunk of more or

;; experienced death), as well as the temporal aspects, make
;; this all seem excessively difficult, but alternatives
;; that make it possible to express the same distinctions of
;; meaning all seem about equally awkward.  In the approach
;; chosen here, Organism and OrganismRemains are conceived
;; as temporally disjoint.  It would be a mistake to apply
;; Dead to an instance of Organism for any time interval,
;; and a mistake to apply Living to an instance of
;; OrganismRemains for any time interval.  In other words,
;; in this approach there are no Dead Organisms, only Living
;; Organisms or Dead OrganismRemains.

;; NS: The ambiguity of &%patient, in particular, creates

;; the other hand, it is also used to gather up just about
;; all of the objects that play any role in a Process,
;; except for &%agent, &%origin, &%destination, and perhaps
;; a few others.  This means that a user (human or

;; strictly means "object acted on/direct object", relate it
;; to those predicates it should subsume, and redefine
;; &%patient to mean "every case role in a Process that is
;; not the &%agent".  Either way, all of the axioms that
;; currently use &%patient and its current subrelations will
;; have to be reviewed and, if necessary, rewritten.  This

;; NS: There is a tendency throughout MILO and the domain

;; compose rules in relative isolation, as if no more
;; general rule already stated somewhere else could possibly

;; Typically, an inference engine will have no way of
;; proving that two skolemized terms should be considered
;; &%equal, so newly introduced terms that "pass in the

;; problem is the relatively small and imprecise (at least

(documentation Tiger EnglishLanguage "The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest
cat species, most recognisable for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on
reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the
genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Tigers are apex
predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are
territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large
contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled
with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated
places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans. [Wikipedia]")

rhino, is one of any five extant species of odd-toed ungulates in the family
Rhinocerotidae, as well as any of the numerous extinct species. Two of these
extant species are native to Africa and three to Southern Asia. Members of the
rhinoceros family are characterized by their large size (they are some of the
largest remaining megafauna, with all of the species able to reach one tonne or
more in weight); as well as by an herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin,
1.5–5 cm thick, formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice
structure; relatively small brains for mammals this size (400–600 g); and a
large horn. They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment
food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter, if
necessary. Unlike other perissodactyls, the two African species of rhinoceros
lack teeth at the front of their mouths, relying instead on their lips to pluck
food. [Wikipedia]")

later applied to the primates on Madagascar. As with other strepsirrhine
primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos (bush babies), lemurs share
resemblance with basal primates. In this regard, lemurs are often confused with
ancestral primates, when in actuality, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and

native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive

panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over

tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity,
they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas
along with specially prepared food. [Wikipedia]")

distribution, native to arctic, subarctic, tundra, boreal, and mountainous
regions of northern Europe, Siberia, and North America. This includes both
sedentary and migratory populations. While overall widespread and numerous,
some of its subspecies are rare and at least one has already become
extinct. For this reason, it is considered to be vulnerable by the IUCN.
Reindeer vary considerably in colour and size. Both sexes can grow antlers
annually, although the proportion of females that grow antlers varies greatly
between population and season. Antlers are typically larger on males. Hunting
of wild reindeer and herding of semi-domesticated reindeer (for meat, hides,
antlers, milk and transportation) are important to several Arctic and Subarctic
peoples. In Lapland, reindeer pull pulks. In traditional festive legend,
Santa Claus's reindeer pull a sleigh through the night sky to help Santa Claus
deliver gifts to children on Christmas Eve. [Wikipedia]")

Acinonyx, the cheetah was first described by Johann Christian Daniel von
Schreber in 1775. The cheetah is characterised by a slender body, deep chest,
spotted coat, a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, long
thin legs and a long spotted tail. Its lightly built, slender form is in sharp
contrast with the robust build of the big cats, making it more similar to the
cougar. The cheetah reaches nearly 70 to 90 cm (28 to 35 in) at the shoulder,
and weighs 21–72 kg (46–159 lb). Though taller than the leopard, it is notably
smaller than the lion. Basically yellowish tan or rufous to greyish white, the
coat is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. [Wikipedia]")

They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and
hybridization suggest they are domesticated descendants of a closely related
species of cavy such as Cavia aperea, C. fulgida, or C. tschudii and, therefore,
do not exist naturally in the wild. Recent studies applying molecular
markers, in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of
current and mummified animals, revealed that the ancestor is most likely
Cavia tschudii. [Wikipedia]")
