;; The distinction between "existing" as a chunk of more or
;; less organism-shaped matter and simply being Dead (having
;; experienced death), as well as the temporal aspects, make
;; this all seem excessively difficult, but alternatives
;; that make it possible to express the same distinctions of
;; meaning all seem about equally awkward.  In the approach
;; chosen here, Organism and OrganismRemains are conceived
;; as temporally disjoint.  It would be a mistake to apply
;; Dead to an instance of Organism for any time interval,
;; and a mistake to apply Living to an instance of
;; OrganismRemains for any time interval.  In other words,
;; in this approach there are no Dead Organisms, only Living
;; Organisms or Dead OrganismRemains.

such as walking or dressing becoming difficult. The two most common
conditions of COPD are &%Emphysema and &%ChronicBronchitis, and they have
been the two classic COPD phenotypes. Emphysema is just one of
the structural abnormalities that can limit airflow and can exist
without airflow limitation in a significant number of people.
Chronic bronchitis does not always result in airflow limitation but in
young adults who smoke the risk of developing COPD is high. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis remain the
predominant phenotypes of COPD but there is often overlap between
them, and a number of other phenotypes have also been
described. The most common cause of COPD is tobacco smoking.
Other risk factors include indoor and outdoor pollution, exposure to
occupational irritant substances such as dust from grains, and cadmium
dust or fumes, and genetics. In developing countries, common
sources of indoor air pollution are the use of coal, and biomass such
as wood and dry dung as fuel for cooking and heating. Most
people living in European cities are exposed to damaging levels of air
pollution. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by
spirometry. [from Wikipedia")

a particular type of surfactant that is derived from oils and fats.  They

fragments of cytoplasm that are derived from the megakaryocytes of
the bone marrow, which then enter the circulation. Circulating
inactivated platelets are biconvex discoid (lens-shaped)
structures,  2–3 µm in greatest diameter. Activated
platelets have cell membrane projections covering their surface.

affinity, binding only to the same epitope (the part of an antigen
that is recognized by the antibody). In contrast, polyclonal
antibodies bind to multiple epitopes and are usually made by several
different antibody secreting plasma cell lineages. Bispecific
monoclonal antibodies can also be engineered, by increasing the
therapeutic targets of one monoclonal antibody to two epitopes. It is
possible to produce monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to
virtually any suitable substance; they can then serve to detect or
purify it. This capability has become an important tool in
biochemistry, molecular biology, and medicine.[from Wikipedia]")

As with most common names, the application of the word is arbitrary, since the larvae of sawflies are commonly called caterpillars as well.[1][2] Both lepidopteran and symphytan larvae have eruciform body shapes.
Caterpillars of most species eat plant material (often leaves), but not all; some (about 1%) eat insects, and some are even cannibalistic. Some feed on other animal products. For example, clothes moths feed on wool, and horn moths feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates.
Caterpillars are typically voracious feeders and many of them are among the most serious of agricultural pests. In fact, many moth species are best known in their caterpillar stages because of the damage they cause to fruits and other agricultural produce, whereas the moths are obscure and do no direct harm. Conversely, various species of caterpillar are valued as sources of silk, as human or animal food, or for biological control of pest plants.[from Wikipedia].")

Reindeer vary considerably in colour and size. Both sexes can grow antlers
annually, although the proportion of females that grow antlers varies greatly
between population and season. Antlers are typically larger on males. Hunting
of wild reindeer and herding of semi-domesticated reindeer (for meat, hides,
antlers, milk and transportation) are important to several Arctic and Subarctic
peoples. In Lapland, reindeer pull pulks. In traditional festive legend,
