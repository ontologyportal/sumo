(subclass ChainGun HeavyMachineGun)
(documentation ChainGun EnglishLanguage "A chain gun is a type of machine gun or automatic
cannon that uses an external source of power, rather than recoil, to cycle
the weapon, and does so via a continuous loop of chain similar to that
used on a motor or bicycle.  Chain gun is a registered trademark of
McDonnell Douglas for a chain-powered weapon.  The primary advantages of
chain-driven weapons over their recoil-actuated counterparts are their
reliability and controllability.  Rather than being dependent upon recoil
to actuate the system, which is usually derived from the detonation of a
cartridge and is thus inherently uncontrollable, a chain gun instead
depends on an external motor to produce power.  The motor drives the
chain, the chain moves in a rectangular loop via four sprockets which
tension it, and one link of the chain is in turn connected to the bolt
assembly, thus the bolt moves back and forth to load, fire, extract and
eject cartridges.  As with other externally-powered guns, this provides a
degree of reliability.  In addition, and again as with all
externally-controlled guns, a misfired round does not stop the weapon - it
is simply ejected.  The speed of the motor also controls how fast the
weapon fires, and thus provides controllability.  During each full cycle
of the chain link attached to the bolt assembly, two periods (passage
along the 'long' sides of the rectangle') control the time taken for the
bolt to drive forward and chamber a round and how quickly it extracts it,
whilst the other two periods - when the chain moves across the 'short'
sides of the rectangle, sideways relative to the axis of the barrel -
determine for how long the breech remains locked (during firing) and open
(allowing extraction and ventilation of fumes etc).  Since it is the time
taken for the chain to move around a complete loop of the rectangle that
controls the rate of fire of the gun, chain guns can theoretically operate
at an infinite number of firing rates from single shot to the maximum
imposed by mechanical etc tolerances.  In practice, chain guns come with
two or three pre-set firing speeds.  (from Wikipedia)")

(subclass M240 AutomaticGun)
(documentation M240 EnglishLanguage "The M240 is a belt-fed 7.62 mm NATO medium
machine gun. It has been used by the U.S. Armed Forces since the end
of the 20th century, and is also used by other NATO forces. It is used
extensively in the infantry as well as on vehicles and
aircraft. Though not the lightest medium machine gun, it is highly
regarded for reliability, and the firearm's standardization with those
of other NATO allies is also seen as a major plus.
The M240 designation is used to describe the whole family, but it is
also a specic variant- a specialized co-axial model. There are many
versions in service, see selected versions below:

    * M240- a co-axial version adopted in 1977 by the US Army for use
    * in tanks. This version of the FN MAG beat out the M60E2 and
    * M219, as well as host of other medium machine guns including the
    * MG3 and AA-52 co-axial versions. Entered service in the 1980s on
    * the M1 Abrams.

    * M240E1- a pintle mounted version that also entered service in
    * the 1980s. Also used by USMC.

    * M240G- a version used by the USMC starting 1994, including in
    * infantry configuration as opposed to the previous vehicle
    * mounted types.

    * M240B- a ground version adopted by the Army in the late 1990s,
    * with deliverys starting around 1998. Includes recoil buffer and
    * front heat guard. Beat out other medium MGs.

been replaced by various versions of the M240 as a medium machine gun, and
by the M249 SAW as a squad automatic weapon.  However, it remains in use
in every branch, as well as some other countries (another major user was
Australia), it continues to be manufactured into the 21st century.  The
M60 can be used in both offensive and defensive configurations.  In the
offense, it provides a higher rate of fire, greater effective range, and
uses a larger caliber round than the standard-issue U.S.  service rifle,
the M16 family.  In defensive use, the long range, close defensive, and
final protective fires delivered by the M60 form an integral part of a
unit's battle plan.  The M60 is effective up to 1,100 meters when firing
at an area target and mounted on a tripod, up to 800 meters when firing at
an area target using the integral bipod, up to 600 meters when firing at a
point target, and up to 200 meters when firing at a moving point target.
United States Marine Corps doctrine holds that the M60 and other weapons
in its class are capable of suppressive fire on area targets out to 1,500
meters if the gunner is sufficiently skilled.  (from Wikipedia)")

histories extending back to the 1800s.  Furthermore, heavier
smaller-caliber weapons continue to be used up to the present.  A classic
example of a rifle-caliber heavy machine gun would be a water-cooled Maxim
machine gun that was belt fed, had a water jacket, was crew served, and
mounted on tripod or wheeled mount.  Other types used linkable strips
(such as the Hotchkiss) or large magazines.  A common example of a
heavy-caliber machine gun would be the Browning M2 .50-caliber machine

(documentation M3M EnglishLanguage "The M3M is a weapon system rather than just a machine
gun.  The system has three parts: The Machine Gun, the Medium Pintle Head
(MPH) or Soft Mount, and the Cradle, which is used to integrate the weapon
into a particular aircraft or vehicle.  An optional Integrated
Illuminator/Laser spotting device gives this weapon a day/night
capability.  Three important differences between the M3M and the M2 BMG:
1) The new weapon uses an open bolt 2) has an internal recoil spring,
and 3) a significantly longer barrel life.  The first difference means
that cook-offs are far less likely to occur while the second point means
that the M3M has only a third as much non-compensated recoil as compared
to the M2 BMG.  As a personal note, I have been on a firing range where
three out of four M2 BMGs had cook-offs following prolonged firing.  Some
problems noted during the initial evaluation of this weapon by the US
Marines in 2001 included: 1) Significantly increased reload times compared
to the M2 BMG.  2) Lengths of rounds were repeatedly pulled from the 100
round magazines by the airstream, resulting in hazards to personnel and
equipment.  3) Lack of a flash suppressor, which made this weapon almost
impossible to use with night-vision equipment.  The feed system for 600
round magazines has been modified to reduce the air stream problem and FN
Herstal has added a flash suppressor, as can be seen below in the second

(documentation MK19 EnglishLanguage "The MK19 (also known as MK-19, M19, Mark 19, or Mk
19) is a belt-fed grenade machine gun capable of firing five grenades per
second.  The Mk 19 fires 40mm grenades at a cyclic rate of 300 to 400
rounds per minute, giving a practical rate of fire of 60 rpm (rapid) and
40 rpm (sustained).  The weapon operates on the blowback principle, which
uses the chamber pressure from each fired round to load and re-cock the
weapon.  The Mk 19 is able to lob its grenade at a maximum distance of
2.2km, though its effective range is about 1.6km.  The nearest safe
distance to launch the grenade is 75 meters.  In addition, the Mk 19's
flash suppressor and its lack of smoke during firing makes it difficult
for enemies to spot and counter it.  For night operation, an AN/TVS-5
night vision sight can be fitted.  The Mk 19 is a man-portable crew-served
weapon that can fire from a tripod mounted position or from a vehicle
mount (this being the preferred method as the weapon alone weighs 33 kg).
The primary ammunition for Mk 19 is the high explosive dual-purpose M430
grenade.  Upon impact, the grenade can kill anyone within the radius of
five meters, and wound them within the radius of 15 meters.  It can also
punch through two inches of armour, which means it can take out most
infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers.  It is
especially deadly when used against enemy infantry formations.  The
ammunition comes in 32 or 48 round cans weighing 42 and 60 lb (20 and 30
kg).  Due to its low recoil and comparatively light weight, it has been
adapted for use on many different platforms, including small attack boats,
fast attack vehicles such as the Humvee (HMMWV) and Stryker, military
jeeps and as well as a large variety of naval mounts.  (from Wikipedia)")

(documentation JavelinWeapon EnglishLanguage "The Javelin is a manportable,
fire-and-forget antitank missile employed by dismounted infantry to defeat
current and future threat armored combat vehicles.  Its range of about 1.5
miles is more than twice that of its predecessor, the Dragon.  The Javelin
has secondary capabilities against helicopters and ground-fighting
positions.  It is equipped with an imaging infrared system and a
fire-and-forget guided missile.  The Javelin's normal engagement mode is
top-attack to penetrate the tank's most vulnerable armor.  It also has a
direct-attack capability to engage targets with overhead cover or in
bunkers.  Its soft launch allows employment from within buildings and
enclosed fighting positions.  The soft launch signature limits the
gunner's exposure to the enemy, thus increasing survivability.  The
Javelin is credited with helping U.S.  Special Forces and Kurdish troops
repel an Iraqi attack in April 2003 in one of the biggest tank battles of
Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Traveling in eight trucks, the coalition troops
were met by surprise attack from an Iraqi brigade.  The Special Forces
used 19 Javelins against the Iraqis, who had 12 tanks and 24 armored
personnel carriers.  The shoulder-held anti-tank weapons stopped two T-55
tanks, eight personnel carriers, and four troop trucks even though not one
of the U.S.  soldiers had ever fired the weapon before the engagement.
The Javelin consists of a missile in a disposable launch tube and a
reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a trigger mechanism and the
integrated day/night sighting device for surveillance, and target
acquisition and built-in test capabilities and associated electronics.
The CLU, powered by a disposable battery, provides the capability for
battlefield surveillance, target acquisition, missile launch and damage
assessment.  The round consists of a disposable launch tube assembly,
battery coolant unit, and the missile.  The 3.5-foot-long missile locks on
to the target before launch using an infrared focal plane array and
on-board processing, which also maintains target track and guides the
missile to the target after launch.  A full-up system weighs 49.5 pounds.
The U.S.  Army awarded the Javelin contract in 1989 to Raytheon and
Lockheed Martin, the weapon was deployed some seven years later.  Since
then at least nine other countries have selected the weapon for their
arsenals.  The Javelin is one of about 1,400 weapon systems supported by
Defense Supply Center Columbus, which supplies several of the missile's
spare parts to the U.S.  Marine Corps through the Performance Based

(documentation SMAWBunkerBuster EnglishLanguage "The Shoulder-launched Multipurpose
Assault Weapon (SMAW) is a versatile, lightweight and lethal weapon
system.  SMAW, employed by the United States Marine Corps for more than
twenty years, has proven performance in combat situations, easily
demolishing bunkers, breaching fortifications, and defeating armored
vehicles.  The man-portable SMAW is exceedingly accurate and reliable,
exhibiting an average hit probability greater than 90 percent on a 1 x 2
meter target at combat ranges.  SMAW is perfectly suited for MOUT
scenarios, enabling the gunner to defeat enemy fortifications while
remaining under protective cover, greatly enhancing survivability.  SMAW
will feature even greater capability with a new Confined Space
fire-from-enclosure version.  Talley Defense Systems, in cooperation with
the US Marine Corps, is perfecting a design which drastically reduces
backblast and over-pressure, and virtually eliminates flash and smoke when
firing the weapon.  The SMAW is an 83mm man-portable weapon system
consisting of the MK153 Mod 0 launcher, the MK 3 Mod 0 encased HEDP
rocket, the MK 6 Mod 0 encased HEAA rocket, and the MK217 Mod 0 spotting
rifle cartridge.  The launcher consists of a fiberglass launch tube, a 9mm
spotting rifle, an electro-mechanical firing mechanism, open battle
sights, and a mount for the MK42 Mod 0 optical and AN/PVS-4 night sights.
The SMAW MK153 Mod 0 launcher is based on the Israeli B-300 and consists
of the launch tube, the spotting rifle, the firing mechanism, and mounting
brackets.  The launch tube is fiberglass/epoxy with a gel coat on the
bore.  The spotting rifle is a British design and is mounted on the right
side of the launch tube.  The firing mechanism mechanically fires the
spotting rifle and uses a magneto to fire the rocket.  The mounting
brackets connect the components and provide the means for boresighting the
weapon.  The encased rockets are loaded at the rear of the launcher.  The
spotting cartridges are stored in a magazine in the cap of the encased
rocket.  The SMAW system (launcher, ammunition and logistics support) was
fielded in 1984 as a Marine Corps unique system.  At that time, the SMAW
included the MK153 Mod 0 launcher, the MK3 Mod 0 HEDP encased rocket, the
MK4 Mod 0 practice rocket and the MK217 Mod 0 9mm spotting cartridge.  The
MK6 Mod 0 encased HEAA rocket is being added to the inventory.  The MOD 0
has demonstrated several shortcomings.  A series of modifications is
currently planned to address the deficiencies.  They include a resleeving
process for bubbled launch tubes, rewriting/drafting operator and
technical manuals, a kit that will reduce environmental intrusion into the
trigger mechanism, and an optical sight modification to allow the new HEAA
rocket to be used effectively against moving armor targets.  Recently
fielded were new boresight bracket kits that, when installed, will solve
the loss of boresight problem between launch tube and spotting rifle.

after experience in the Vietnam War revealed the inadequacy of the 7.62 mm
Minigun for gunship use.  The M197 is essentially a lightened version of
the General Electric M61 Vulcan cannon, with three barrels instead of six.
Its maximum rate of fire is one quarter that of the Vulcan, largely to
limit its recoil for light aircraft and helicopter use.  It shares the
Vulcan's M50 and PGU series 20 mm ammunition.  The M197 went into service
on later marks of the AH-1 Cobra, and was also fitted in a ventral turret
on the U.S.  Marine Corps OV-10D Bronco.  It is also the basis of the
GPU-2 gun pod, which incorporates the cannon, a battery and electric drive
motor, and 300 rounds of linkless ammunition.  In the Cobra, the weapon is
supplied with a magazine of 700 linked rounds.  It has a cyclic rate of
fire of 730 rounds per minute (plus or minus 50 rounds).  Standard practice is to
fire the cannon in 100-round bursts, allowing several minutes of cooling
time between bursts.  The M197 remains in use in the latest AH-1W and
AH-1Z Cobra gunships.  Although the weapon's rotary drive is theoretically
quite reliable, its ammunition feed has been anything but: Marine pilots
report an alarmingly high jam rate (sometimes greater than 30%).  The USMC
and the manufacturer are aware of the problem, but no specific fix has
been incorporated on the AH-1Z.  In the meantime, crews have been trained
in techniques intended to minimize the risk of jamming.  (from

(documentation GuidedMissile EnglishLanguage "Missiles that have the ability to
maneuver through the air can be guided, and are known as guided
missiles. These have three key system components:
    * tracking
    * guidance
    * flight
A tracking system locates the missile's target. This can be either a
human gunner aiming a sight on the target (remotely from the missile)
or an automatic tracker. Automatic trackers use radiation emanating
from the target or emitted from the launch platform and reflecting
back to it from the target. Passive automatic trackers use the
target's inherent radiation, usually heat or light, but missiles
designed to attack Command & Control posts, aircraft or guided
missiles may look for radio waves. Active automatic trackers rely on
the target being illuminated by radiation. The target can be painted
with light (sometimes infrared and/or laser) or radio waves (radar)
which can be detected by the missile. The radiation for the painting
can originate in the missile itself or may come from a remote station
(for example, a hilltop gunner can illuminate a target with a laser
device and this can be used to direct an air launched guided missile).
A guidance system takes data from the missile's tracking system and
flight system and computes a flight path for the missile designed to
intercept the target. It produces commands for the flight system.
The flight system causes the missile to maneuver. There are two main
systems: vectored thrust (for missiles that are powered throughout the
guidance phase of their flight) and aerodynamic maneuvering (wings,
fins, canards, etc).
There are some similarities between guided missiles and guided
bombs. A guided bomb, dropped from an aircraft, is unpowered and uses
aerodynamic fins for forward horizontal maneuvering while falling
vertically. (from Wikipedia)")

(documentation AGM114 EnglishLanguage "AGM-114 Hellfire (Helicopter launched
fire-and-forget) is a U.S.  air-to-ground missile system designed to
defeat tanks and other individual targets while minimizing the exposure of
the launch vehicle to enemy fire.  Hellfire uses laser guidance and is
designed to accept other guidance packages.  It is used on helicopters
against heavily armored vehicles at longer standoff distances than any
other U.S.  Army missiles now in the inventory.  The Hellfire II is the
optimized version of the laser family of Hellfire missiles.  The Longbow
Hellfire Modular Missile System is an air-launched, radar aided,
inertially guided missile that utilizes millimeter-wave radar technology.
Despite the expanded acronym, most versions of the Hellfire missile are
not truly fire-and-forget -- all the laser-guided versions require
constant illumination or painting of the target from launch to impact.
The AGM-114L is a true fire-and-forget weapon: it requires no further
guidance after launch and can hit its target without the launcher being in
line of sight of the target.  The Hellfire (along with the Maverick and
the air-launched TOW) was to be replaced by the Joint Common Missile (JCM)
around 2011.  The JCM was developed with a tri-mode seeker and a
multi-purpose warhead that would combine the capabilities of the several
Hellfire variants.  In the budget for FY2006, the US Department of Defense
canceled a number of projects that they felt no longer warranted
continuation based on their cost effectiveness, including the JCM.  Due to
the U.S.  military's continuing need for a proven precision-strike
aviation weapon in the interim until a successor to the JCM is fielded, as
well as extensive foreign sales, it is likely the Hellfire will be in
service for many years.  (from Wikipedia)")

(documentation MolotovCocktail EnglishLanguage "Molotov cocktail, named after Vyacheslav
Molotov, also known as petrol bomb, benzine torch, molotov grenade or
molotov bomb, is the generic name for a variety of crude incendiary
weapons.  While they are commonly associated with irregular military
forces and rioters, they are actually more frequently used for basic
arson[citation needed].  In urban slang, they are often referred to as a
homemade frag or the poor man's hand grenade.  A Molotov cocktail consists
of a glass bottle partly filled with flammable liquid, typically petrol,
alcohol, methanol or ethanol.  The mouth of the bottle is stopped up with
a cork or other type of airtight bung, made of rubber, glass, or plastic,
and an igniter, such as cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth.  The
weapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately
prior to using it, lighting the rag, and throwing the bottle at the
target.  The bottle shatters on impact, spilling the flammable liquid over
the target, which is then ignited by the burning rag.  There are also
sophisticated methods for igniting, such as use of pyrophoric mass Bengal
fire or a chemical igniter based on reaction of sulfuric acid and
potassium chlorate, which do not need an external source of fire to work.
Additional substances may be added to the basic Molotov cocktail to
enhance its use as a weapon.  Molotov cocktails are similar to napalm
bombs in principle.  Napalm was originally made by combining flammable
naphthalene and petrol with a thickening agent palmitic acid, the latter
two being the main ingredients of Molotov cocktails.  When gasoline is
used as the main ingredient, motor oil or sugar is commonly added to help
the gasoline cling to the target.  (from Wikipedia)")

retrospect may be one of the holy grails that has yet to be fully
fulfilled for general aircraft.  V/STOL was originally developed to allow
fast jets to be operated from clearings in forests, removing their
reliance on damage-prone runways, or operated from small aircraft carriers
that would previously only have been able to carry helicopters.  V/STOL
has been replaced by STOVL or short takeoff, vertical landing in
operation, if not in design.  A rolling takeoff, sometimes with a ramp
reduces the amount of thrust required to lift a fully laden aircraft from
the ground, and increases the payload and range.  For instance, the
Harrier is incapable of taking off vertically with a full weapons and fuel
load, and hence is operated as STOVL wherever possible.  The main
advantages in the case of the Harrier is closer basing, which reduces
response time and tanker support requirements.  In the case of the

(documentation LCAC EnglishLanguage "The air cushioned landing craft, or fully amphibious
landing craft, is a more modern variation on the amphibious landing boat.
These craft are based on small to mid sized multi-purpose hovercraft, also
known as 'over the beach' ('OTB') craft.  This allows troops and material
to access more than 70% of the world's coastline, while only approximately
15% of that coastline is available to conventional landing craft.  Typical
barriers to conventional landing craft are soft sandy beaches, marshes,
swampland, and loose surfaces.  Air cushion technology has vastly
increased the landing capability of the craft, providing greater speed and
flexibility over traditional landing craft.  Like the mechanized landing
craft, they are usually equipped with mounted machine guns, although they
also support grenade launchers and heavy weapons.  These vehicles are
commonly used in the United States Navy, which first received them in
1984, the Russian Navy, and some other modern fighting forces, such as the
United Kingdom's Royal Navy.  Forces that may use the LCAC may include The
Royal Marines.  (from Wikipedia) ")
